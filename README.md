Causal Neuroscience 
==============================


++++under construction++++

This repository archives our efforts to study and understand the topic of causality and how to apply it in the framework of neuroscience. It is intended for those who seek to understand and hopefully include causal inference in their scientific work.

The current context is an **annotated bibliography in the *references* folder**. Its a collection of texts we read in our studies. The annotations are meant as guidance for interested readers. We very briefly report our experience with the literature, blogs and videos, and how they helped us to develop our current understanding. 

The folder ***notebooks* contains jupyter notebooks on different topics in causality**. They give you a low barrier entry to causal analysis in python. You find introductions to existing packages designed to facilitate your work. Explanations are always combined with illustrated implementation examples.

The folder ***blog posts* is a collection of text on different subtopics in causality**.
